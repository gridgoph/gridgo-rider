/**
 * app.json stays the whole configuration. This file only stamps the build
 * identity onto it.
 *
 * A sideloaded APK has no store listing, so the version a rider reads in
 * Settings → Apps is the only handle anyone has on "which build is on this
 * phone". Leaving it at the app.json value means every APK ever shipped calls
 * itself 1.0.0, and Android refuses to install one release over another
 * unless `versionCode` has gone up.
 *
 * So the build number owns the patch segment: app.json keeps MAJOR.MINOR as
 * the release line, CI appends its run number (`GRIDGO_BUILD_NUMBER`, set in
 * `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`), and `versionCode` is that same
 * number. With no build number — any local `expo start` — the app.json version
 * stands unchanged and nothing pretends to be a release.
 *
 * The rule lives here rather than in `lib/`: @expo/config evaluates this file
 * with its own TypeScript loader, which does not resolve an extensionless
 * relative `.ts` import, and the `.ts` spelling that does resolve is a `tsc`
 * error (TS5097). `__tests__/appConfigVersion.test.ts` calls these exports
 * directly, so the rule is tested where it runs.

/**
 * Where this build's `google-services.json` comes from.
 *
 * Push on Android needs the Firebase config for `ph.gridgo.rider` in project
 * `gridgo-c2ce9`. One file covers all three GRIDGO packages and the Expo plugin
 * picks the entry by package name. That file is the captain's and is **never
 * committed** — `.gitignore` keeps it out — so it reaches a build as
 * configuration:
 *
 * - `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` names a path (what CI sets, from a repository
 *   secret written to a file outside the workspace);
 * - otherwise a `google-services.json` dropped in the repo root is used, which
 *   is how a developer's machine and a local release build get it;
 * - otherwise the key is omitted entirely.
 *
 * Omitting is deliberate rather than fatal: `npx expo start`, `npx tsc`, the
 * test suite and `npx expo config --type public` all have to work on a machine
 * that has never seen the file, and they do — the build simply has no Firebase,
 * `getDevicePushTokenAsync` throws, and `store/push.ts` treats push as
 * unavailable and shows no card. What must never happen quietly is a *release*
 * built without it, so `.github/workflows/android-release.yml` asserts the file
 * is present, and is this app's, before it calls prebuild.
 *
 * A path that is named and missing is always an error: it means the wiring is
 * broken, and falling back would ship an APK that silently never receives
 * anything.
 *
 * @param envPath `process.env.GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`.
 * @param projectRoot directory the repo-root fallback is resolved against.
 * @param fileExists injected for the test; defaults to a real filesystem check.
