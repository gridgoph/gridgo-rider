/**
 * The iPhone build's native settings that no package plugin gets right on its
 * own. Every mod here is an iOS mod, so the Android build is untouched.
 *
 * - **No background audio.** expo-audio's plugin adds `UIBackgroundModes:
 *   audio` by default, and App Review refuses a background mode the app does
 *   not use (guideline 2.5.4). GRIDGO plays its sounds in the foreground only.
 *   The plugin's own `enableBackgroundPlayback: false` would also remove an
 *   Android service and permission, so the mode is taken out here instead.
 * - **Dynamic frameworks.** `@react-native-firebase` resolves the Firebase iOS
 *   SDK through Swift Package Manager, which needs `use_frameworks! :linkage
 *   => :dynamic` (https://rnfirebase.io/ios-spm). Set through
 *   `Podfile.properties.json`, the same key expo-build-properties writes.
 * - **Firebase, only with its file.** Push on iPhone goes through Firebase
 *   Cloud Messaging, which needs `GoogleService-Info.plist`. Firebase's own
 *   plugin also rewrites the Android build, so only its two iOS steps run:
 *   copy the file into the project and call `FirebaseApp.configure()`. A build
 *   without the file gets neither, because `configure()` with no file crashes
 *   the app at launch; `store/push.ts` then reports push unavailable.
