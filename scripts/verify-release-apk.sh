# Verify a release APK before anyone sideloads it, or a release Android App
# Bundle (.aab) before the captain uploads it to Google Play.
#
# Two things can be wrong with a build that looks perfectly green in CI, and
# both of them only show up on a rider's phone:
#
#   1. It is signed with the debug key. Expo's generated `android/app/build.gradle`
#      points the release build type at `signingConfigs.debug`, so a plain
#      `assembleRelease` produces a debug-signed APK that installs happily and
#      can never be upgraded by a real release.
#   2. It points at localhost, or Clerk is missing. `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are
#      inlined by Babel when the JS bundle is built, not read at runtime. The
#      Clerk value reaches Expo extra at prebuild and also has a static env read
#      that Babel can inline at Gradle time.
#
# Neither is visible from the build log, so both are asserted here against the
# actual artifact. Nothing this script prints contains a password, a key, or
# the API URL — a certificate fingerprint is public (it ships inside the APK).
#
# An AAB is checked the same way. It is jar-signed rather than APK-signed, so
# its certificate is read with `jarsigner`/`keytool -printcert -jarfile`
# instead of `apksigner`, and its bundle sits under the `base/` module. Google
# Play re-signs what it serves with the app signing key; the upload key checked
# here is what Play Console accepts the upload with.
#
# Usage:
#   ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH=… ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=… ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=… \
#   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=… EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=… \
#   EXPO_PUBLIC_CARTO_API_KEY=… \
