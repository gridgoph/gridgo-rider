# Verify a release APK before anyone sideloads it.
#
# Two things can be wrong with a build that looks perfectly green in CI, and
# both of them only show up on a rider's phone:
#
#   1. It is signed with the debug key. Expo's generated `android/app/build.gradle`
#      points the release build type at `signingConfigs.debug`, so a plain
#      `assembleRelease` produces a debug-signed APK that installs happily and
#      can never be upgraded by a real release.
#   2. It points at localhost, or Clerk is missing. `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are
#      inlined by Babel when the JS bundle is built, not read at runtime. The
#      Clerk value reaches Expo extra at prebuild and also has a static env read
#      that Babel can inline at Gradle time.
#
# Neither is visible from the build log, so both are asserted here against the
# actual artifact. Nothing this script prints contains a password, a key, or
# the API URL — a certificate fingerprint is public (it ships inside the APK).
#
# Usage:
#   ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH=… ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=… ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS=… \
#   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=… EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=… \
#   scripts/verify-release-apk.sh path/to/app-release.apk
