# GRIDGO Play updates

A small Android-only Expo module wrapping Google's `app-update:2.1.0` library.
It offers only the flexible flow. Download completion emits `downloaded`;
`completeUpdate` is called only after the rider chooses **Restart now**.
Errors return to JS, where they are silent. There is no Store redirect.

Expo SDK 57 discovers local modules under `modules/` automatically through
`expo-module.config.json`. The existing release workflow's `expo prebuild`
and Gradle steps include this module without a config plugin or workflow
change. There is no Apple implementation. Native Play objects and listeners
are created only on the first method call; `lib/playUpdate.ts` resolves the
module only when `installChannel()` is `play`.

`hooks/usePlayUpdateCheck.ts` checks after the launch intro and on foreground,
at most once per four hours, including across app launches. The timestamp is
per installed version. A completed download is recovered on the next eligible
check; a download completed while this process is alive prompts on foreground.
Both Play consent and restart prompts wait until no job is active. The shared
trip store requires a successful read for the current foreground/session
generation, with no read or offer acceptance in flight. Foreground changes
and queued trip hints invalidate idle permission synchronously, before the
identity read or trip refresh starts. Unknown or failed reads defer updates.
A download that finishes during a job stays pending until a new trip read
confirms the job has ended. **Restart now** rechecks this guard before installing.

Why local: `expo-in-app-updates@0.12.0` automatically completes flexible
updates and redirects to the Store on failure. Its current `0.13.x` release
targets Expo SDK 58+. `sp-react-native-in-app-updates@2.0.0` does not expose
`installStatus()` when checking, so it cannot recover a downloaded flexible
update after process death. This module uses the installed SDK 57 Expo Modules
API and preserves explicit restart consent without patching either package.

A real check needs a Play-installed build owned by an eligible tester, a higher
version code available on that tester's track, and matching Play signing.
Jest mocks the native boundary; it cannot verify Play rollout eligibility,
consent UI, downloads, or installation.
