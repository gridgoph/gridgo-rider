/**
 * The release workflow's two load-bearing properties, asserted here because
 * neither shows up in a build log.
 *
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined by Babel while the JS bundle is built, so
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` has to be in the environment of the command that runs
 * the bundle — the gradle build. Set on the runner beforehand, in an earlier
 * step, or exported afterwards, it does nothing at all, and the APK falls back
 * to the loopback base in `lib/api.ts`: green in CI, dead on every phone in
 * Davao. `scripts/verify-release-apk.sh` catches it against the built
 * artifact; this catches it against the workflow, before a 20-minute build.
 *
 * And a pull request must never produce a signed release build, so the job
 * that touches the signing key is fenced off from that trigger.
 *
 * Parsed as text rather than YAML: this repo has no YAML parser as a declared
 * dependency, and the questions are about which step a line sits in.
