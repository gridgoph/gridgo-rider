/**
 * The scrolling body of any screen that has a field on it.
 *
 * This replaced React Native's `KeyboardAvoidingView`, which was covering the
 * field a rider was typing into. Three separate reasons, and the last one is
 * the reason no amount of tuning `behavior` would have fixed it:
 *
 *  1. Android did nothing at all. Every call site passed
 *     `behavior={Platform.OS === "ios" ? "padding" : undefined}`, and with no
 *     behavior `KeyboardAvoidingView` renders a plain `View`. It relied on the
 *     window resizing under it — which stopped happening the moment this app
 *     went edge-to-edge (`android.edgeToEdgeEnabled`, and mandatory from
 *     Android 15): the IME arrives as a window inset now, the app keeps its
 *     full height, and there is nothing for that component to measure.
 *  2. It resizes a container; it never scrolls. Sign-up asks for seven fields
 *     and the pickup escalation note sits at the bottom of a long page, so
 *     "the container is shorter now" still leaves the focused field under the
 *     keyboard.
 *  3. It knows nothing about a scroll view's content inset, so the submit
 *     control below the last field became unreachable without dismissing the
 *     keyboard first.
 *
 * `KeyboardAwareScrollView` answers all three: it extends the scrollable area
 * by the keyboard's real height and scrolls the focused input above it.
 *
 * The layout classes go on a `View` inside, not on the scroll view itself.
 * `KeyboardAwareScrollView` is a third-party component, so NativeWind does not
 * replace it and a `className` on it would be dropped in silence — the same
 * trap that `components/Screen.tsx` documents for `SafeAreaView`.
