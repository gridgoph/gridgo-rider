/**
 * The opening. GRIDGO Rider drawing itself, then handing the screen over.
 *
 * Ported beat for beat from the legacy Flutter app
 * (`printing_app/apps/mobile/lib/features/splash/screens/splash_screen.dart`),
 * which is where this sequence was designed and approved:
 *
 *   1. Nine dots light one at a time in a spiral from the bottom-left, each
 *      rising from a ghost to its own colour, with the intro sting under them.
 *   2. The top-right dot — the one the mark lights, the job on the grid —
 *      swells until it is the whole screen.
 *   3. GRIDGO fades up on that yellow field, on the outro sting.
 *   4. Everything fades, and the app is underneath.
 *
 * The swell is the one bold moment; nothing else on the screen competes with
 * it. The dots resolve to exactly the colours `GridgoMark` draws, so what the
 * grid finishes as is the mark itself rather than a lookalike.
 *
 * This is an overlay over the whole navigator, not a route. Session restore,
 * push handling and the launch ladder all run underneath it exactly as they do
 * without it — nothing about where a launch lands is decided here.
