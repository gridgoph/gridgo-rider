/**
 * The invitation to turn on phone alerts.
 *
 * This card is the *only* thing in the app that can raise the system
 * permission dialog. Android 13+ shows that dialog once and treats a refusal as
 * effectively permanent, so firing it cold on first launch — before a rider has
 * seen a single job — spends the one ask on a stranger. Instead the card is
 * drawn where the value is already obvious and states in one line what will
 * arrive; the dialog follows a deliberate tap and nothing else.
 *
 * Placement follows AGENTS.md's Push notifications guidance. Keep the request
 * beside the job or alert that makes its value clear.
 *
 * Refusal is a first-class outcome. Nothing is blocked, no screen changes, and
 * Alerts keeps every update: the card simply becomes a pointer to the phone's
 * own settings, which is the only place a blocked permission can be taken back.
 *
 * A `SecondaryButton`, never the yellow one: the primary action on any screen
 * this appears on belongs to the job, not to a notification setting.

   * draws nothing most of the time — a wrapper would leave empty page on every
   * phone that has already granted permission, which is all of them after the
   * first tap.
