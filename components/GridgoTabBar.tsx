/**
 * The GRIDGO tab bar.
 *
 * Four labelled destinations and one unlabelled action.
 *
 * The labelled columns are a fixed 52px: an 8px foot, a 16px label box, a 4px
 * gap and a 24px glyph, bottom-aligned so all four share a baseline. Every one
 * of those boxes is pinned rather than measured, so no platform's text metrics
 * can move the icons. The action is a 56px disc — no label, because a filled
 * yellow plus in the middle of a tab bar needs no caption, and captioning it
 * would put a fifth word in a row of four.
 *
 * The disc's column is taller than the labelled ones, so the disc rises out of
 * the row on its own and the bar surface, which starts 16px below the row's
 * top edge, is what it breaks through. Nothing is ever drawn outside its
 * parent, which Android will not reliably render.
 *
 * The open tab is said twice over, in colour and in weight: its glyph goes
 * from muted to full-strength ink and its label from muted regular to medium.
 * The row therefore still reads correctly in grayscale. Yellow is spent in one
 * place only — the disc that starts a print request.
