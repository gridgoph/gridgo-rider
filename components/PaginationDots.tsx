 * strewn about. Widening it back with `hitSlop` is not the fix: sibling touch
 * areas would then overlap far enough that a dot's region covered its
 * neighbour's centre, and the later sibling wins — so tapping one dot would
 * select the next. An unambiguous narrow slot beats an ambiguous wide one,
