/**
 * Disconnecting Sign in with Apple when an account deletion is requested
 * (App Store Review Guideline 5.1.1(v); gridgo-api
 * `docs/APPLE_REVOCATION_API.md` is the contract).
 *
 * The deletion request is filed first and stands whatever happens here. Only
 * an iPhone whose Clerk user has an Apple account runs this step: Apple asks
 * the rider to sign in once more, and the fresh authorization code goes to
 * GRIDGO, which exchanges and revokes it with Apple. The code never reaches
 * Clerk, so the signed-in identity does not change.
 *
 * Two retry rules come from Apple's codes being single use:
 *
 * - **A lost answer resends the same code** before Apple is asked again.
 *   GRIDGO replays a recorded attempt instead of spending the code twice.
 * - **After a disconnect, Apple is never asked again.** A new sign-in could
 *   authorize the app all over again. That holds across visits to the screen:
 *   GRIDGO's own record (`GET /me/account-deletion-request`) is read before
 *   any new sign-in, and a disconnect this app saw is remembered for the
 *   account and request until the signed-in account changes.
 *
 * The same in gridgo-client and gridgo-supplier except `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`.
