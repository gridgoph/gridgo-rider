/**
 * Firebase Cloud Messaging on iPhone.
 *
 * gridgo-api sends every push through FCM HTTP v1. On Android that already
 * reaches the phone, because expo-notifications returns an FCM token. On iOS
 * expo-notifications returns the raw APNs token, which FCM cannot address, so
 * the iPhone build asks Firebase for an FCM token instead and the same sender,
 * token type and payload serve both platforms. Firebase maps that token to the
 * APNs token itself, using the APNs key uploaded to the Firebase project.
 *
 * Everything else about push stays with expo-notifications: the permission
 * dialog, the foreground handler and the tap that opens an order.
 *
 * Never imported statically by anything that loads at launch, and never
 * trusted to exist: Expo Go has no Firebase, and a build made without
 * `GoogleService-Info.plist` has the native module but no configured app
 * (`plugins/withIosStoreBuild.js` leaves `FirebaseApp.configure()` out of it).
 * Both answer null, and `store/push.ts` falls back to what it did before.
